# Wine Education

Wine culture is notoriously known for being snobby, and only accessible to rich people.
As a result, getting into the wine world can be difficult, and can also be expensive, as books, courses and the wines themselves can be very expensive.

The purpose of this project is to provide resources for aspiring wine experts and sommeliers to learn more about the wine world, without having to unnecessarily spend money on courses.

In terms of the level of detail of the information, I'd like the content to be more detailed than blog posts and casual books, but not too overwhelming that it becomes pedantic and memorization.

I want the overall process to be fun, and very relatable.

## Thoughts about a more unique wine book

There are tons of wine books out there, but some of them are just splats of knowledge (Oxford Wine Companion), which makes learning about wine very inorganic, and other books rely on rote memorization (most of WSET books and most wine books). Can we break down the process of learning wine to be more about certain fundamentals? Maybe think about some more foundational knowledge such as from horticulture, chemistry, geology, geography, history etc? I think some of these are eventually explored at the Diploma and Master levels for wine, but why not earlier? Why not teach good, organic foundations for aspiring wine students?

I'm thinking about some things such as how just learning about mountain effects can help you deduce so many things.

### Mountains, an example

E.g. if a region has a mountain, you can already infer the following

- Differing altitudes on the mountain provide climates, such as
  - Lower altitude is generally warmer
  - Higher altitude is colder
  - Higher altitude has higher diurnal range
  - Large diurnal range is generally good for grape growing, since it helps the grape ripen during the day, but preserve acidity at night. This can then link to a more elaborate article about grape ripening.
- Mountains often provide steep hillsides for growing
  - Steeper aspect generally helps with more sunlight, allowing for more ripening
  - Steeper hills have better drainage, which prevents excess water logging
  - Steeper hills also help with airflow since winds tend to be stronger
- Mountains provide shelter from weather effects. We call this the "rain shadow"
  - This includes winds, clouds (rain), and thus make areas on the "correct" side of the mountain more calm and more suitable for growing grapes
  - This also means that if an area is surrounded by 2 mountains, such as Napa Valley, the area in between is more calm and idyllic for grape growing

Some things I think I can infer about mountains from general knowledge (need to check)

- Mountains have infertile soil. This is good for controlling yield on grapes.
  - I need to check the infertile soil part, but I would imagine this is the case since nutrients can get swept down to the foothills.
- Mountains that have snow at the summit can melt and provide water for grapes (e.g. the Andes)

The idea of this exercise is to show the deduction process that can be gained from

1. Thinking in this deductive manner
2. Using a strong foundation to derive more knowledge

This type of skill is very useful, as it helps you learn new topics easier just by knowing some basic facts about the region, and then you can also infer facts about regions you've never heard of either.

You can imagine this is pretty useful in deductive tastings, where you can infer certain facts about a wine just by tasting it, which tells you how it was probably made.
