# Wine Education

Wine culture is notoriously known for being snobby, and only accessible to rich people.
As a result, getting into the wine world can be difficult, and can also be expensive, as books, courses and the wines themselves can be very expensive.

The purpose of this project is to provide resources for aspiring wine experts and sommeliers to learn more about the wine world, without having to unnecessarily spend money on courses.

In terms of the level of detail of the information, I'd like the content to be more detailed than blog posts and casual books, but not too overwhelming that it becomes pedantic and memorization.

I want the overall process to be fun, and very relatable.
